I started off by considering the 3d model portion of the graveyard project. I'm considering using the app Polycam on my phone which can take LiDAR data and make a model of the gravestones (and from what I understand LiDAR will give higher quality results as opposed to photos or videos). Although I don't know what you'll want us to exactly do when it comes to the photogrammetry.

Next, I begun editing the kobotoolbox form for something more relevant to Canadian cemeteries. Here are the changes I made and justifications:

1. Adding "Rebuilt as a new gravestone" option to "Condition of monument" prompt. As I said previously, many gravestones at the cemetery I was working at were reerected later on with any trace of the original gravestone having vanished. This was with the exception of the "mother" and "father" stones I mentioned, which were simply laid right behind the much larger modern stone.
2. Adding "Too degraded to tell" option to "If there is a quote, the nature of the quote". Some stones I looked at had quotes but were too eroded to read the whole thing, so I could not answer the nature of the quote, in which case I had just put "other"
3. Adding question "Distance, if applicable, from church (in meters)" I think this is relevant to all cemeteries, especially the one I studied. I'd imagine that gravestones closer to a given church are older and perhaps belonged to prominent individuals, if the plots closer to the church were/are more expensive.
4. Adding question "Proximity to relative's gravestones" 4 of the gravestones I studied were beside their relatives or significant others. That is: two (likely) twins whose stones were beside each other's and a wife and husband (father, mother). This could help us understand burial practices.
5. Adding question "Photograph of back" I don't see how this could hurt to have as additional information. The back of gravestones could tell us more information of its condition and age.

Other than that, I think the previous form was good, and I didn't see the need to delete anything. If my gravestone didn't have a feature which was prompted in the questions, I put a 0 (or the relevant number) for the fact that it did not have that feature.

"It was a golden island of sugar; it was also hell on earth for many hundreds of thousands of enslaved peoples brought there to work through forced migration."

I've always wondered about Caribbean identity. In countries like Jamaica, Haiti, Barbados, etc. the population is overwhelmingly black, with the Indigenous populations having been wiped out centuries ago from disease or slavery. It is interesting to see modern Caribbean identities and cultures form from the islands that black people found themselves on after their liberation from slavery. Its like Canada where many Canadians claim a Canadian descendancy because they've forgotten about where they came from, or in the brutal case of slavery, deliberately taken from their native land.

"The majority of residents of Barbados were therefore segregated in death, as in life,
from the places of burial and memory from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries." Cook, Katherine. 2018 Negotiating Memory: Funerary Commemoration as Social Change in Barbados. African and Black Diaspora: An International Journal. 79.

Needless to say, this is very ironic considering how un-Christian this action of burial segregation is. But again, slavery is inherently un-Christian. I wonder in England Anglican church's opinion on slavery was, I know the UK eventually banned slavery, buying and freeing all slaves in the British Empire, a great step to equality. The Catholic church also expressed issues with what Christopher Columbus was doing in the Carribbean, he was even sent back to Spain bound in chains because of his unusally cruel actions there. And thats coming from a society which had slavery; Columbus must have been especially evil.

It would be interesting to look at early African American graves in the American South who became wealthy. Although I'm pretty sure because of how the South was reconstructed there was a deliberate attempt made to hinder black Americans from succeeding in their lives. But I'm sure a few must have become sucessful. What could their graves tell us?

I would really, really like to see something like this be implemented in Greece. It would be so interesting if all burial spaces were doucmented from the Neolithic, Minoan, Mycenaean, Geometric, Archaic, Classical, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Frankish, Venetian, Ottoman, and Modern periods (many more groups of people I'm leaving out as well...) Changes in burial practices and burial locations could be viewed spatially to see how they relate to other areas of Greece. Eg. is X part of Greece more conservative in their burial practices, i.e. do they keep to a more ancient practice of internment and if so why? The possibiltiies would really be endless.

"Children werenâ€™t considered significant in the
economic and social lives of their communities or as part of the cosmological and
emotional worlds of those in the past, and this sensibility kept children virtually
absent from archaeological inquiry for generations" Baxter, Jane Eva. 2020. Emotional Practice and Emotional Archaeology- A Perspective from the Archaeology of Childhood in Kisha Supernant, Jane Eva Baxter, Natasha Lyons, Sonya Atalay (eds). Archaeologies of the Heart, Springer, Cham. 126.

When I was doing an archaeological field school in Greece this past summer, one week of it was dedicated to a bioarchaeology lab cataloguing bones that had been excavated the year previous from an early Christian Basilica in Nicopolis, Epirus. I have to be fully honest, although many of the bones we were looking at were from children, I did not feel an ounce of sadness or any emotion for that matter. Maybe I'm a psychopath, but I do get feelings when I visit the National Archaeological Museum in Athens which has many Classical and Hellenistic grave stelai. Bones can't tell me anything empathetically about the deceased: we all have bones. A grave stele on the other hand, tells me their name, parents clasping the childs hand, and any pets they were fond of like a rabbit or a dog. And the XAIPE (farewell!) is a nice final message akin to RIP in our world. 

I did feel a closer connection however to bones when I visited my Chorio in Greece. Chorio literally means village, but it has taken a secondary, more popular meaning of a village that you came from. In the 20th and 21st century Greece has seen an outflow of people to Athens, Canada, the US, and Australia. Most people during the summer travel back to their Chorio to pay hommage to their lowly origins. In many ways it is literally a pilgrimage; most people go to their Chorio for religious festivals like the Dormition of the Virgin Mary. My chorio (at least my paternal chorio; my grandparents come from many different villages) is called Melissopetra, about 11 people live there permanently. We visited the cemetery and saw many of my relatives who I had never met. In Greek Orthodoxy, after 7 years of burial, the bones are exhumed from the grave, washed, and placed into a box. After some more time (I don't remember the exact number), the bones are then indiscriminately thrown into a larger repository. Looking into the large bone pit of Melissopetra, I couldn't help but think how many of those people were my ancestors, who had spent their whole lives in some tiny, very isolated village in the Arcadian mountains. My grandfather was 18 when he left Melissopetra for Athens, when he saw the ocean for the first time he thought it was a large field of crops. I got to wondering if my ancestors could even begin to conceive of the vastness of Canada and the New World. How would I be able to explain artifical intelligence to them? These bones were a reminder of how far I've come from my true roots, but also a feeling that I truly belong in Arcadia despite me living life in Canada.

In summary this week I decided what photogrammetry method I am going to use for next week, created a webmap with my cemetery and stones, and had a look at spatial analysis. Some were better sucesses than others.
