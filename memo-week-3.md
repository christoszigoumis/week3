I'm maybe starting off a bit late to the coding aspect of this week, but will try to get as much done as possible. 

I first started off by having making the first itieration of the map on Jupyter lab using the geojson mapping software. I ran into a slight problem, but realized I hadn't put in the fist and last { and }. Easy fix. 

As of this moment, when I try typing in the url to my web browser after starting the server on Python, it says "Error response
Error code: 404

Message: File not found.

Error code explanation: 404 - Nothing matches the given URI."

I have no idea what to do next, I'll put it in the discord and see if anyone knows.

It works after putting in just "localhost:8001" so thats good. I am happy about that.
