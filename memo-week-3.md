I'm maybe starting off a bit late to the coding aspect of this week, but will try to get as much done as possible. 

I first started off by having making the first itieration of the map on Jupyter lab using the geojson mapping software. I ran into a slight problem, but realized I hadn't put in the fist and last { and }. Easy fix. 

As of this moment, when I try typing in the url to my web browser after starting the server on Python, it says "Error response
Error code: 404

Message: File not found.

Error code explanation: 404 - Nothing matches the given URI."

I have no idea what to do next, I'll put it in the discord and see if anyone knows.

It works after putting in just "localhost:8001" so thats good. I am happy about that. For some reason I cannot drag and drop the webmap folder into the Netlify website, but I will figure that out later.

I found old Ottawa maps to download, one of which includes the area of the church, but my macbook literally won't let me download it for some reason no matter what I try. The shame is that I was excited to georeference an old map of Ottawa because I spent basically a month georeferencing aerial photos of Mani.

I sucessfully created the webmap with my church and boundaries of it as a polygon, I plotted my five gravestones on the map as well, and it works as a website.
