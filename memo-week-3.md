I'm maybe starting off a bit late to the coding aspect of this week, but will try to get as much done as possible. 

I first started off by having making the first itieration of the map on Jupyter lab using the geojson mapping software. I ran into a slight problem, but realized I hadn't put in the fist and last { and }. Easy fix.
